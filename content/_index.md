Meshtastic is an open-source, decentralized, off-grid mesh network. It's made up of small communicators that can form a mesh network.
These communicators can be linked to a phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
Meshtastic uses inexpensive LoRa radios as a long-range communication platform.

We're working to set up a mesh network of solar-powered radio repeaters in the Tri-Cities, TN area (Kingsport, Johnson City, and Bristol).
Users also contribute to the network using their personal Meshtastic devices.
These radios communicate in the 915 MHz ISM band using the LoRa protocol.
The radios mesh using the open-source Meshtastic software.
Users can connect to these repeaters by Bluetooth if theyâ€™re close enough, or they can use their own handheld nodes, which will also act as repeaters.
The messages hop from node to node, extending the reach of the network and ensuring everyone receives every message.
